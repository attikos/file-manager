Move file (same as copy but initial file is deleted):  
`mv path_to_file path_to_new_directory`  

Delete file:  
`rm path_to_file`  

#### Operating system info
Get EOL (default system End-Of-Line)  
`os --EOL`  

Get host machine CPUs info (overall amount of CPUS plus model and clock rate (in GHz) for each of them)  
`os --cpus`  

Get home directory:  
`os --homedir`  

Get current system user name (Do not confuse with the username that is set when the application starts)  
`os --username`  

Get CPU architecture for which Node.js binary has compiled  
`os --architecture`  

#### Hash calculation
Calculate hash for file and print it into console  
`hash path_to_file`  

#### Compress and decompress operations
Compress file (using Brotli algorithm)  
`compress path_to_file path_to_destination`
